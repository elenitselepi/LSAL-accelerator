# LSAL-accelerator
Github repository for the implementation of LSAL. Implement an application for local sequence alignment, an algorithm widely used in bioinformatics. The algorithm is developed first in software running on x86 and Zedboard Arm processors, and then as a hardware accelerator running on the Zedboard fabric.

At the folder software is the optimal software design and at the folder hardware is the optimal hardware design (kernel and host). A detailed report that outlines our
experiments, presents the results using tables and figures, and discusses and explains these results are given in the pdf Report.pdf 

Hardware accelerator is x2,3 times faster than the optimal software implementation.
